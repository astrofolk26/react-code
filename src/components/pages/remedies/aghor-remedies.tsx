Aghor Remedies, since this is one of the most esoteric and powerful branches of Vedic–Tantric practice. The Aghor tradition is associated with Lord Shiva in his fierce yet compassionate form, and its remedies focus on transformation, liberation, and protection from deep karmic afflictions.
<br/>
Aghor remedies are rituals and practices rooted in the Aghori tradition, emphasizing fearlessness, transcendence of dualities, and dissolution of karmic obstacles. They are not mainstream household remedies but specialized spiritual practices performed under guidance, often in sacred spaces like cremation grounds or powerful temples.
