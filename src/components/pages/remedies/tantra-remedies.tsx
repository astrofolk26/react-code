 Tantra Remedies, since they are often misunderstood but form a profound part of Vedic and spiritual traditions. Unlike pooja, mantra, meditation, or yoga remedies, tantra remedies focus on energy transformation, ritual precision, and symbolic practices to dissolve karmic blockages and invoke divine forces.

<br/>
Tantra remedies are ritualistic and energetic practices rooted in the Tantric tradition. They use yantras, mantras, mudras, and offerings in highly structured ways to channel cosmic energies. Their goal is not just planetary pacification but deep transformation of consciousness and karmic patterns.
