    <p className='text-justify'></p>
    You may feel caught in the middle this week, playing the role of mediator in a conflict you did not start. While your diplomatic skills are needed, be careful not to sacrifice your own stance just to keep the peace. Your mind is sharp, making this a great week for writing, negotiating, or having difficult conversations—as long as you remain honest rather than just agreeable.
