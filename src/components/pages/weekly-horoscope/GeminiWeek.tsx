    Your social calendar is likely overflowing, and your mind is buzzing with a dozen different conversations. While the connection is invigorating, you run a high risk of burnout by mid-week. You do not have to attend every event or answer every text immediately. Furthermore, be very clear in your communication; a casual comment could be easily misinterpreted by a close partner. Slow down to speed up.<br/><br/> <b>Power Day: Sunday</b>
