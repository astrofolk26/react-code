  This week, the energy shifts from the initial enthusiasm of Sagittarius season into a slightly more pragmatic phase. As we head toward December, many signs will feel the tug-of-war between wanting to expand their horizons and the need to buckle down and handle practical responsibilities before the holidays fully kick in. It’s a week for balancing big dreams with necessary details.
