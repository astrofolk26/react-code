     <p className='text-justify'>
   You are craving comfort and predictability, but the universe is asking you to stretch a little. An opportunity—perhaps related to education, travel, or a new perspective—presents itself, but it requires leaving your cozy routine. Do not immediately say no just because it is unfamiliar. Financially, this is a good week to review budgets, but avoid impulse buys made to self-soothe.<br/> <b>Power Day: Friday</b>
