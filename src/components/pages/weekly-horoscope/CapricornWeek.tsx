      As you approach your birthday season, your solar year is winding down. You might feel quieter, more introspective, and lower energy than usual. Honor this need for rest. It is not the time to launch massive new endeavors. Instead, focus on wrapping up loose ends and reflecting on what you want to leave behind in 2025. Your intuition is louder than usual; listen to it
