    The focus this week is heavily on your relationships and the balance of give-and-take. You have been doing a lot of nurturing lately, perhaps at the expense of your own energy reserves. Resentment might start to bubble up if you feel unappreciated. It is okay to say NO to a request in order to say YES to your own mental health. Draw boundaries with kindness, but draw them firmly.<br/><br/><b> Power Day: Tuesday</b>
