Your natural impulse is to charge ahead, but this week you might hit a few frustrating speed bumps. It feels like you have one foot on the gas and one on the brake, particularly regarding career matters. Do not try to force progress through sheer willpower. Instead of initiating new battles, use this week to refine your strategy. Patience is not your strong suit, but it is your most necessary tool right now.
