<b>How are these predictions made?</b>
<p>
  Astrologers analyze the major planetary transits (e.g., Jupiter&apos;s movement through signs, Saturn&apos;s ingresses, Rahu/Ketu&apos;s shifts, and the slower outer planets longer-term influences) in relation to the houses and planets of each general zodiac sign. For instance, if Jupiter transits a particular house for a specific sign, it might bring expansion and opportunities to that area of life for people born under that sign.
