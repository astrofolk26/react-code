<b>How are these predictions made?</b>
<p>
  Astrologers analyze the faster-moving planetary transits (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars) as they move through different signs and houses, and how they interact with each general zodiac sign&apos;s energetic blueprint. They also factor in the background influence of slower-moving planets. The approach of the New Year (and the Winter Solstice) often adds themes of completion, reflection, and new beginnings.
