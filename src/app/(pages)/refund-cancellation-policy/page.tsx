Refund & Cancellation Policy – Astrofolk<br/><br/>
1. Service Nature<br/>
Astrofolk provides personalized astrology services, including birth charts, remedies, consultations, and spiritual ceremonies. Because these services are customized to each individual, certain restrictions apply to cancellations and refunds.
<br/><br/>
2. Cancellations<br/>
- Digital Services (Charts, Reports, Remedies):<br/>
- Once delivered, these services cannot be canceled as they are personalized and non‑reusable.
<br/>- Scheduled Consultations:<br/>
- Cancellations made at least 24 hours before the scheduled time are eligible for rescheduling or refund.
<br/>- Cancellations made within 24 hours of the scheduled time are non‑refundable.
<br/>- Ceremonies & Poojas:
<br/>- Cancellations made 72 hours before the scheduled event are eligible for a full refund.
<br/>- Cancellations made after this period may incur administrative charges or be non‑refundable depending on resource commitments.
<br/><br/>
3. Refunds<br/>
- Eligibility:<br/>
Refunds are processed only for cancellations that meet the above criteria.<br/>
- Non‑Refundable Items:<br/>
- Completed astrology reports, remedies, or consultations.<br/>
- Donations or contributions made for spiritual causes.<br/>
- Processing Time:<br/>
Approved refunds will be credited to the original payment method within 7–10 business days.<br/>
- Partial Refunds:<br/>
If a service has been partially delivered, Astrofolk may issue a prorated refund at its discretion.
<br/><br/>
4. Rescheduling<br/>
- Consultations may be rescheduled once without additional charges if requested 24 hours in advance.
<br/>- Ceremonies may be rescheduled subject to availability and resource commitments.
<br/><br/>
5. Exceptions<br/>
<br/>- Technical issues (e.g., failed payment, duplicate charges) will be fully refunded.
<br/>- If Astrofolk cancels a service due to unforeseen circumstances, a full refund or reschedule option will be provided.
